      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I attained a Bachelor's in Asian Studies, with my studies mostly focusing on East Asia and the Japanese language. I studied abroad at Osaka University, where I took classes completely in Japanese. I took that opportunity to immerse myself fully in their culture, and made trips to many destinations in Western Japan. It was a life-changing time; the experience not only provided the full context in which the language is used, but matured me in a way I may not have achieved at home. </p>
      <p></p>   
      <p> I continued to study Japanese after college, by keeping contact with my friends abroad and making new ones online. In 2013 I visisted again, this time spending most of my trip in the Tokyo area. In 2016 I landed a job as a Japanese conversational coach for the North Carolina Virtual Public School back in the States. I had the pleasure of engaging with highschool students via Japanese conversations. It was amazing watching how the students would improve week by week. I loved encouraging them, and soon enough I even had the more shy students speaking. It was the most rewarding job I've ever had. </p>
         
         <p>I want to continue my passion for sharing the Japanese language and giving others confidence to practice speaking while also making it fun.</p>
