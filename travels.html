    <p>I've had the privilege to travel since I was very little. My mom tells me I was a frequent flyer when I was younger, and even flew on my own from Germany to Panama when visited my grandmother (I was of course chaperoned by a flight attendant). My upbringing helped cultivate a love for traveling and I have continued to do so when time and money allows it. I would like to tell you one of my favorite trips I have ever taken.</p>
