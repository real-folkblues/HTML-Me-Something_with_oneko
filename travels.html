    <p>I've had the privilege to travel since I was very little. My mom tells me I was a frequent flyer when I was younger, and even flew on my own from Germany to Panama when visited my grandmother (I was of course chaperoned by a flight attendant). My upbringing helped cultivate a love for traveling and I have continued to do so when time and money allows it. I would like to tell you one of my favorite trips I have ever taken.</p>

    <h1>The Faroe Islands</h1>

    <p>I signed up for a landscape photography workshop in August 2018 for the Faroe Islands. Our guide was Mads Peter Iversen, a young Danish photographer with an impressive portfolio whose landscape photos can be described as surreal, even otherworldly. The video below is from a series of videos he did on the islands, and he's done many more since. I highly recommend watching as the sights are breathtaking</p>
